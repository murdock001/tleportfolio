                    <p style="text-align: center;">Hello. My name is Julian John A. Olivar. I was born in July 4, 2011 ðŸ¦… which makes me 14 years old. My favorite color is green, and my favorite day is christmas since I am catholic and a believer of Christ which elevates the meaningfulness of the holiday by infinite.</p>

                                    <p style="text-align: left;">(image of me holding my notebooks)</p>
                                        <p style="text-align: center;">During my free time I like to draw and write short stories on any given medium, because I have ideas that I want to get down, to see something as mine and something to be proud of. My favorite color is green, and my favorite day is christmas since I am catholic and a believer of Christ which elevates the meaningfulness of the holiday by infinite.</p>

                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>When it comes to my circle of friends, I would say its a little complicated but in summary I do have friends. Sometimes I enjoy socialization, hanging out with others, and making new friends. But a lot of the times I like being alone. But not in the sense where I'm lonely, just some alone time where I can be myself. I like to hit the sweet spot of both introvert and extrovert, so you could call me an ambivert. But I feel like I lean more on introvert because my friendships from this school aren't that deep, and the ones I made in my old school are gone.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">This is my family <img src="https://html-online.com/editorfiles/tiny/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-laughing.gif" alt="laughing" />. We are a catholic family with healthy relationships. We all love each other and support one another. I am the eldest among my siblings, so I have to be a better role model for them because I love my siblings wholeheartedly. I also love my parents and I want to be a respectful child towards them</p>
